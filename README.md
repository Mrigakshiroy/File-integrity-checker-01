#DESCRIPTION : This Python script monitors changes in files within a specified directory by calculating and comparing hash values, ensuring file integrity over time and it uses the "hashlib" library to compute SHA-256 hashes of files. File hashes are stored in a file_hashes.json file. It compares the current file states with the stored hashes to identify changes. If a file is modified, its hash changes, which is detected and reported. New files are identified when they appear in the directory but are absent in the stored record, while deleted files are flagged if they were previously recorded but no longer exist. The script is useful for verifying file integrity, monitoring backups, and auditing changes in critical directories. It works seamlessly with all file types, including .docx, and provides a robust solution for ensuring file consistency over time.
